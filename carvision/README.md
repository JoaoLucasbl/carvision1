# Carvision

College project for the web development class, with focus on PHP use.


## Installation

This project use Docker to make easier the installation process. Follow the steps below to configure the enviroment.
> If you don't want to use docker, you can check the versions used for every tool on the compose.yaml.

- 1 . Download and install docker in your machine. [Get Started.](https://www.docker.com/get-started/ )

- 2 . Check if your docker and docker-compose was installed successfully by tipping:

```bash
    docker -v
    docker-compose -v
```

- 3 . Now let's run our containers by building our compose.yaml:


```bash
    docker-compose build -d
```

> "-d" start the containers in the background and leaves them running.

> We are able to set our project to be listen on port 8080 because of the apache that is included into the docker image.

- If everything went well, you now can access the web application at **localhost:8080**
